ga-bitbot Cryptographic Package Signing Utility

    This utility can cryptographicaly sign packages and upload them to the gene server
    or download and verify packages from the gene server 
    
    If no RSA key pair already exists then one will be created automatically

    A signed package is a json dictionary containing:
     - RSA public key
     - base64 encoded signature (RSA4096 encrypted SHA512 hash of the plain text and package name)
     - base64 encoded plain text data (may be zlib compressed)
     - MD5 hash of the plain text
     - package name
     - compression flag

    The signature guarantees the origin of the package contents to the owner of the public key
